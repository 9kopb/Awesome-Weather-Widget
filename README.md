Do widgets need to be licensed under GPL v3+?
---------------------------------------------
I'm not a lawyer (and of course can not provide legal advice, so take this with a grain of salt), but I do not believe widgets _need_ to be as they are separate "programs" (packaged and installed separately). However, I do recommend that all widgets be GPL v3+ licensed. However, in simplest terms: __no__.

This is, of course, unless you include something GPL licensed in your code (jQuery here being excluded, as it is [dual licensed MIT and GPL](http://jquery.org/license/)).
