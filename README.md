Do widgets need to be licensed under GPL v3+?
---------------------------------------------
I'm not a lawyer, so take this with a grain of salt:

If your widgets are built from this widget, then it must be GPL v3 licensed. If you make a widget from the (shell widget)[https://github.com/michaelhart/NTP-Widget-Shell] or your own custom code, then it doesn't need to be GPL v3 licensed.
